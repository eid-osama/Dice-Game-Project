# the-complete-js-course-2nd-project
This project is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Players can either continue rolling to accumulate points or hold their score to pass the turn to the other player. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their current accumulated points and the turn is passed to the other player.
